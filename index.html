                <p>The need to transform the matter, to build something that wasn't there before. That's what drove me from drawing to sculpture, from sculpture to set-design, from set-design to writing, and from writing to web development and game creation.
                    There's always a lot to learn. Fortunatly, learning is my favorite kind of relation with the world.</p>
